### 🧠 GPT-5 Performance Metrics (Live Test)

```
🎯 RESULTS:
   Total GPT-5 decisions: 4
   Average confidence: 80.0%
   Average processing time: 22.3 seconds
   Total tokens used: 7,946

🧠 REASONING_EFFORT USAGE:
   minimal: 1 decision  (6.6s, 1,149 tokens)
   medium: 1 decision   (32.5s, 1,551 tokens)  
   high: 2 decisions    (25s avg, 2,623 tokens avg)

📝 VERBOSITY USAGE:
   low: 1 decision     (quick responses)
   medium: 1 decision  (balanced detail)
   high: 2 decisions   (comprehensive analysis)
```

### 🎛️ Parameter Control WORKING

✅ **reasoning_effort**: MINIMAL → MEDIUM → HIGH  
- MINIMAL: 6.6s processing, 1,149 tokens
- HIGH: 25s processing, 2,623 tokens
- **Higher effort = 2.3x more tokens, 3.8x longer processing**

✅ **verbosity**: LOW → MEDIUM → HIGH  
- LOW: Concise decisions
- HIGH: Detailed analysis and reasoning

✅ **GPT-5 Model**: Confirmed using `gpt-5` model (not GPT-4)
