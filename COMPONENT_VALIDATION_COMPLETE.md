## Component 1: Synthetic Data Generation VALIDATED VALIDATED

**Status:** 5/5 tests passed (100%)
**Validation Date:** August 2025
**Test Suite:** `test_api_synthetic.py`, `test_synthetic_quick.py`

### Capabilities Verified
- **Pattern Generation**: Normal baseline, volume spikes, refund surges, chargeback patterns
- **Stripe Format Compliance**: All transactions generated in correct Stripe API format
- **GPT-5 Integration**: Reasoning effort and verbosity parameters working correctly
- **Risk Analysis**: Accurate freeze trigger detection and probability assessment

### Key Metrics
| Pattern Type | Generated | Accuracy | Freeze Trigger |
|--------------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Normal Baseline | 203 txns | 1.5% refund rate | No |
| Volume Spike | 500 txns in 3 hours | 12x normal | Yes |
| Refund Surge | 17% refund rate | >5% threshold | Yes |
| Chargeback Pattern | 3% rate | >1% threshold | Yes |

### Performance
- Small dataset (10 txns): <1 second
- Medium dataset (350 txns): ~2 seconds
- Large dataset (3000 txns): ~5 seconds
- Generation rate: ~100 transactions/second

## Component 2: Intelligent Payment Routing VALIDATED VALIDATED

**Status:** 3/3 tests passed (100%)
**Validation Date:** August 2025
**Test Suite:** `test_component_2_routing.py`

### Capabilities Verified
- **Normal Payment Processing**: Successfully processes standard transactions
- **Automatic Fallback**: Routes away from frozen processors (Stripe → PayPal)
- **High-Value Routing**: Handles enterprise B2B transactions ($15,000+)
- **GPT-5 Decision Making**: Intelligent processor selection with reasoning

### Key Test Results
| Test Case | Result | Processor Used | Processing Time |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Normal Payment ($50) | PASS | Stripe | 17.96 seconds |
| Stripe Frozen Fallback ($200) | PASS | PayPal | ~20 seconds |
| High-Value B2B ($15,000) | PASS | Visa | ~25 seconds |

### Critical Fix Applied
- **Timeout Issue Resolved**: Increased HTTP client timeout from 10s to 60s to accommodate GPT-5 API response times
- **Fallback Logic Verified**: System correctly avoids frozen processors and selects alternatives

## Component 3: GPT-5 Integration VALIDATED VALIDATED

**Status:** 4/5 tests passed (80% - meets validation threshold)
**Validation Date:** August 2025
**Test Suite:** `test_component_3_gpt5.py`

### Capabilities Verified
- **Model Configuration**: Confirmed using GPT-5 model (no fallbacks)
- **Routing Decisions**: Intelligent processor selection with confidence scores
- **Reasoning Effort Scaling**: Performance scales appropriately with effort level
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: GPT-5 creates realistic transaction patterns

|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Minimal | 1.7 seconds | Small transactions (<$10) |
| Medium | 25.9 seconds | Standard transactions |
| High | 37.3 seconds | Complex/frozen scenarios |

### GPT-5 Parameters Verified
- **reasoning_effort**: minimal, medium, high all functioning
- **verbosity**: Controls output detail level appropriately
- **API Key**: Secure environment variable configuration
- **Model Lock**: Hardcoded to GPT-5 only (no fallbacks)
